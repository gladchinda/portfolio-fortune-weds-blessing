                    <strong>Love beautifies, Love strengthens, Love heals</strong>. I and my sharp girl (Boss Lady) <strong>"Beee"</strong>, have been distant friends way-long, not knowing too well that someday, some how we will get to connect this way. We met, we became friends, we became close friends, we became best friends, we fell in love. Time went by, our love endured all that came our way. We loved the more with each breath and every beat of our hearts. Every sunset and sunrise strengthened our love for each other. We understand each other &amp; our thoughts intertwined, fused together in silent comprehension. The storms cross our path and we stood stronger, fearless. Happiness fills our hearts, we are at peace &mdash; we have known true miracle and it has changed us. We are reborn, never to be the same again.

                    It's truly amazing, how God's grace found us and brought us this far. It's really truly exciting, how love captured and knitted our hearts, as one. We are grateful to God, for being at the centre of our love life. <strong>We are Love! We are One!</strong>
